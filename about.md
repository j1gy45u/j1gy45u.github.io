### Hey there,

My name is Jigyasu and I'm 18 years old student living in India.

I spend most of my time sleeping [(literally)](https://www.dreams.co.uk/sleep-matters-club/your-life-in-numbers-infographic/#:~:text=The%20average%20person%20spends%20about,12%2C045%20days%20spent%20in%20bed!), and when awake, I like creating things with code, the animation at the top of this webpage is one of the examples of those creations.

Sometimes I also read fictions, play ukulele and keep looking for new adventures meanwhile. 

This is kind of my home on the internet, I talk about things that I learn in the process, occasionaly.

### Hey there,

I'm Jigyasu, an 18 year student from India and I'm on my journey to (un)learn things.

Finding magic and reasoning already set ideas and standards are two of my favorite passtimes.

I spend most of my time sleeping, and when awake, I like doing creative coding, reading fictions, playing ukulele and finding new adventures.

This is my blog, where I share the stuff I learn in the process (mostly computers and all the cool things happening around it), it helps me self introspect myself and my journey.

### Hey there,

My name is Jigyasu and I'm 18 years old student living in India.

I spend most of my time sleeping [(literally)](https://www.dreams.co.uk/sleep-matters-club/your-life-in-numbers-infographic/#:~:text=The%20average%20person%20spends%20about,12%2C045%20days%20spent%20in%20bed!), and when awake, I like creating things with code, the animation at the top of this webpage is one of the examples of those creations.

And I also read fictions, and play ukulele sometimes.

This is kind of my home on the internet where I talk about the things that I learn in the process.

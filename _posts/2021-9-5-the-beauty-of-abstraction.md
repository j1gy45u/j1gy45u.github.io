title: The Beauty Of Abstraction
published: true

We humans, as a species have an unparalleled ability to create. And abstraction forms the basis of all the creations.

Even computer science concretely relies on it.

We're so obsessed with the aesthetically beautiful interfaces in the high-level world that we totally forget how amazing and magical the roots are. 

Have you ever thought, what leads to the working of a modern computer?

After all, they just receive simple electronic signals, so what really makes those physical entities mingle with the highly sophisticated software architectures?

Well, that'd be a lot to explain at once, it definitely took a long while to reach this stage where you just need to type in a keyword, hit enter, and the Google's [PageRank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank) runs through millions of web pages to throw up the result in a matter of few milliseconds.

Abstraction, by definition, means to create something which you can use again and again for different purposes without worrying about the underlying process. 

Suppose the engineers at a big fintech firm need to design a portal for their company, what would they do? Probably they'd design a prototype first and then implement it in some high-level languages like [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) or [Python](https://www.python.org/) along with some [Framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework), put it on a server, and get it running. 

Now imagine what the consequences would have been without the application of abstraction. They'd have had to start from the absolute ground-up, from building their own logic gates and chipsets to writing an operating system and setting up their own server. 

That would indeed be a tedious job, but then all thanks to abstraction,  somebody somewhere in time already built those chipsets, wrote that operating system and created the server.

We don't even realize that in our practical usage of computers, and therein lies the beauty of it.

Abstraction lets us completely forget about the 'how' while allowing us to be creative in our true potential.

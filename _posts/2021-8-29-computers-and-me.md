*Our universe is a sorry little affair unless it has in it something for every age to investigate.*
â€• Seneca, 1st century CE

This quote stands eternal and universal. Starting off with an intentional pun that applies to the world of computers.

I grew up in a family which wasn't really tech-savvy, my interactions with the computer were almost zero. 

We had basic mobile phones at home definitely but it was in 5th grade, when I was 10, that I got my hands on a real computer in the school's computer lab. 

I was introduced to [LOGO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language) ) as a part of our computer science curriculum.


It's a Lisp-based educational programming language that uses [Turtle](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/turtle-graphics) to help learners create computer graphics. 

I found it really fascinating, you just had to input some commands and boom a star would pop on the screen.

And then, things like binary and [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) appeared, I was having the time of my life, making cool graphics and creating a calculator was fun for sure, but it was only after two years when [Java](https://java.fandom.com/wiki/Java) came into the scene. And it made me hate the computer altogether.

Not the language, but the way it was taught. 

I wasn't able to work with those pre-defined syntaxes and that's what our course demanded, it always intrigued me, what happens underneath the hood?

And the teachers weren't helpful at all, so I decided to give up.

It was only in high school that I again encountered programming languages, this time not as a course though. 

I started teaching myself [Python](https://www.python.org/), and why? 'Cause everyone was doing that. 

This time things made much more sense, but I soon had the realization that I was moving ahead without a purpose. 

I didn't want a job, computers fascinated me and I wanted to learn things and play with them. So, I again gave up. 

Although, this time I ended up having a good knowledge of how things work and also got a fair understanding of Python and [C](https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/c).

But me being me, I'm still fascinated by the convergence of software and hardware architectures in a modern computer. 

So, I continue to dive deeper into it while developing a thing for modern programming languages and their application in stuff like deep learning, AI, generative art and design and etcetera.
